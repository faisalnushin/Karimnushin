                    <p><strong>"The only way to do great work is to love what you do." â€“ Steve Jobs</strong></p>
                    <p>I am Faisal Nushhin, from Afghanistan. Currently, I am a senior computer science student with a passion for Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. My journey in technology began at a young age, sparked by a fascination with how things work and an insatiable curiosity about the digital world.</p>
                    <p>Growing up, I was deeply influenced by the rich cultural heritage of Afghanistan, which instilled in me a strong sense of identity and community. This background has driven my commitment to represent Afghanistan authentically, especially in my role as the incoming president of the ASA club at my university.</p>
                    <p>My academic pursuits have been complemented by hands-on projects, the most notable being my senior project: developing a web-based inventory management system for E-Waste Recovery Solutions. Utilizing Flask, jQuery, Bootstrap, and SQLite, this project underscores my dedication to innovation and enhancing data integrity.</p>
                    <p>Beyond academics, I have a keen interest in photography and content creation. Through my Instagram handle @avestaphotos, I capture and share the world's beauty, from the high-octane excitement of car shows to the serene landscapes of Lake Tahoe. I also enjoy playing Call of Duty with friends, which adds an exhilarating dimension to my leisure time.</p>
                    <p>Looking ahead, my goals include advancing my expertise in Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence, contributing to meaningful projects that bridge technology and social impact, and continuing to create content that resonates with and inspires others. I aspire to make a significant mark in the tech world while staying true to my roots and values.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to explore my website to learn more about my journey, view my projects and publications, and connect with me on shared interests.</p>
